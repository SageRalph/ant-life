# ant-life

A game with bugs

Ant Life is a web game inspired by [Powder Game](https://dan-ball.jp/en/javagame/dust/)
and [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life),
but instead simulates the behaviour of ants and their environment.

By placing and clearing tiles and guiding ants using pheromone trails you can help
them farm plants and fungus, which queens will consume to lay eggs. To achieve
a high score, design your colony to maximise sustainable growth and avoid deadly
hazards like water and pests.

Ant Life works on desktop and mobile, but may lag on older phones due to the
complexity and implementation of the simulation.

Ant Life is implemented in JavaScript using Canvas.
